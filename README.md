# re:Solve

A mobile-first escape room card game that teaches through immersive storytelling. Players explore rooms, collect items, solve puzzles, and piece together narratives — all within a timed session.

## Play Online

https://beta.re-solve.cloud/app/home.html

## Run Locally

1. Start a local server:

   ```
   npx http-server -p 8080 -c-1
   ```

   or with Python:

   ```
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:8080/app/home.html

Requires any modern browser. The game loads JSON via fetch, so `file://` won't work.

## How It Works

Each **category** contains multiple **episodes**. An episode is a self-contained escape room with:

- **Rooms** — locations the player unlocks and explores
- **Cards** — items (red), objects (blue), events (yellow), penalties (black)
- **Puzzles** — interactive lock components that gate progression
- **Combinations** — item + object pairings that trigger discoveries
- **Narrative** — voice-narrated story segments (intro, mid-event, endings)
- **Scoring** — stars based on time, penalties, and hints used

Episodes are data-driven — the engine renders any scenario from JSON. Adding a new episode requires no code changes.

```

## Adding a New Episode

1. Create `scenarios/<category>/<episode-slug>/`
2. Add JSON files: `meta.json`, `cards.json`, `rooms.json`, `puzzles.json`, `combinations.json`, `events.json`, `narrative.json`, `scoring.json`, `image-style.json`
3. Register the episode slug in `scenarios/<category>/index.json`
4. Generate assets: `python tools/cards_to_images.py scenarios/<category>/<episode>`
5. Generate voice: `python tools/narrative_to_voice.py scenarios/<category>/<episode>`

## Tests

```bash
npm test                 # Unit tests (Node 18+)
npm run test:e2e         # E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:all         # Both
```
